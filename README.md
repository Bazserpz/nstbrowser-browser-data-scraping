# NSTBrowser JavaScript Integration Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating how to integrate NSTBrowser with JavaScript, specifically focusing on web automation tasks using WebSocket connections. These examples are designed to help developers understand how to initiate and manage browser sessions programmatically.

## Overview

The examples provided in this repository showcase various capabilities of NSTBrowser, including launching browsers, connecting to existing browser sessions, and creating browser sessions with custom configurations.

### Features

- **Connect to a Launched Browser**: Demonstrates how to connect to an already launched browser session using its profile ID.
- **Launch and Connect to Browser**: Shows how to launch a new browser session with a specific profile and then connect to it.
- **Create and Connect to Browser**: Illustrates creating a new browser session with custom configurations and connecting to it.

## Getting Started

To use these examples, you'll need to have NSTBrowser set up and an API key obtained from NSTBrowser's service.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- An active NSTBrowser account and an API key.

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started with the examples:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NSTBrowser/examples.git
cd examples/js/nstbrowser
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Usage

Each example in the repository is designed to be self-contained. To run an example, navigate to the specific example's directory and execute the script using Node.js. For example:

```bash
node index.js
```

Make sure to replace placeholder values such as `your api key` and `your profileId` with actual values from your NSTBrowser account.
